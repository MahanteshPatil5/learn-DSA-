In the BS we use 2 varialbes and then loop also so to remove that we use 
2 pointers like start and end 

Types of Two Pointer (IMPORTANT)

🔹 Type 1: Start–End Pointer
Used in:
reverse array
pair sum in sorted array
palindrome check

🔹 Type 2: Slow–Fast Pointer
Used in:
remove duplicates
move zeros
filtering elements
Example idea:
slow → keeps valid position
fast → scans array


we have to think about this 2 pointers when 
1.array is sorted 
2.do i need pairs
3.can i reduse the nested loop 


this 2 pointers concept is used to soloove time complexity 
like reduce O(n^2) to O(n)
